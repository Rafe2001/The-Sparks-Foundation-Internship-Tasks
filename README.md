Task 1 : Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)
Objective : Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
           What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?
           
 
 Task 2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)
 Objective: From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters
and represent it visually.


Task 3 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail (Level - Beginner)
Objective :
● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’

● As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can
work to make more profit.

● What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?


Task 4 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism (Level - Intermediate)
Objective :
● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’

● As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.

● What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?


Task 5 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm (Level - Intermediate)
Objectice : 
● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to
predict the right class accordingly.
